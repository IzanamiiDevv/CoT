## Introduction to C++

C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language used for system software, games, and many other applications. It builds on C by adding object-oriented features, making it both versatile and complex.

## Basic Concepts

### Variables and Data Types

Learn about different data types in C++, including fundamental types like `int`, `float`, `char`, and more.

### Operators

C++ provides several operators such as arithmetic (`+`, `-`), logical (`&&`, `||`), and comparison (`==`, `!=`). Understanding these is key to writing effective code.

### Control Flow

Control flow structures include `if`, `else`, `switch`, and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`). These allow for decision-making and repetitive tasks in your programs.

## Object-Oriented Programming

### Classes and Objects

Understand how to create and use classes, the building blocks of object-oriented programming in C++.

### Inheritance

Learn how to derive new classes from existing ones to promote code reuse.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows for dynamic method binding, making code more flexible and reusable.

## Advanced C++ Features

### Templates

Templates enable generic programming, allowing functions and classes to operate with different data types.

### Standard Template Library (STL)

STL is a collection of template classes and functions, including data structures (like `vector`, `list`, `map`) and algorithms.

### Smart Pointers

Smart pointers (`std::shared_ptr`, `std::unique_ptr`) help manage dynamic memory safely and efficiently.

## Memory Management

### Dynamic Allocation

Learn about `new` and `delete` and how to properly manage heap memory in C++.

### RAII

Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) is a key C++ idiom for managing resource lifetimes.

## Error Handling

### Exceptions

Understand how to use `try`, `catch`, and `throw` to handle errors and exceptions gracefully.

## Concurrency

### Threads

Learn how to create and manage threads in C++ to perform parallel tasks.

### Mutexes and Locks

Understand how to prevent race conditions and ensure thread safety using mutexes and locks.

## Best Practices

Explore tips and best practices for writing efficient, readable, and maintainable C++ code.

## Projects and Exercises

Practice what you've learned through hands-on projects and exercises included in this repository.
