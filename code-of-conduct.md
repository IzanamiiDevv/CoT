# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive community for all contributors and participants in the **CoT: C++ of Things** repository. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for behavior and the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in this community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Harassment in any form, including unwanted comments or actions related to a person's identity or experience.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct that is inappropriate for a community that values inclusion and respect.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subjected to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the maintainers at [insert contact email or link]. All reports will be handled confidentially and investigated promptly.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. 

If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community.
